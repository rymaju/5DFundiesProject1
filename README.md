## Artist Statement

My project is a software development methodology that punishes developers for making mistakes by deleting all of their work. The idea is that this an effective, although cruel, form of creating a culture that values cautious and careful design at all costs. This is directly in contrast with real development methodologies like Lean and Agile which aim to fail fast and embrace mistakes. Consequently, examining the opposite development ideology in which mistakes are severely punished can help us understand how our current development ideologies affect how we perceive and think about software development, and what values (good and bad) these ideologies implicitly impart on developers.

The project is comprised of two main media. One is the website which is used to present the ideas of the design through visuals, text, and an interactive\* demonstration. The website is built using static HTML, CSS+Bootstrap, and Javascript for the interactive demo. The wireframing and graphical design of the website was done using Figma, a popular design software. The design was aesthetically inspired by the ReactJS website, which has a minimalist modern design.
The other is a shell script that can be used to enforce the design methodology. You can download, configure, and run it to work as described. Included in my documentation is a link to the Github repository with the shell script and how to use it.
